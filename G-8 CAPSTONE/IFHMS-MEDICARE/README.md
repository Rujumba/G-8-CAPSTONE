# Call Center Ticket System

Virtual Solutions Call Center is a leading provider of customer support services, handling a high volume of incoming inquiries from various clients. To streamline their operations and enhance customer satisfaction, they are in need of a robust ticketing system. The system will enable their call center agents to efficiently manage customer issues, provide timely resolutions, and maintain accurate records of all interactions.
Problem Statement: The current manual process of managing customer inquiries at Virtual Solutions Call Center is inefficient and prone to errors. Agents struggle to keep track of incoming tickets, retrieve relevant information quickly, and provide timely updates to customers. As a result, customer satisfaction levels are decreasing, and the company's reputation is at risk.
